First we need to create all the nodes we will use with the tree


Create example tree
                       Persian Empire (Alexander the Great)
                      /
             Classical Antiquity -- Roman Empire
            /         \
           /           Han Dynasty
          /
         /          Ancient Egyptians
        /          /
History -- Bronze Age -- Sumarians
        \          \
         \          Indus River Valley Civilization
          \
           \       Dark Ages
            \     /
            Middle Ages -- Charlamegne Empire
                  \
                   Mongol Empire

The Markdown translation for this is as follows:

History.md
---
[[Classical Antiquity]]
[[Bronze Age]]
[[Middle Ages]]

Classical Antiquity.md
---
[[Persian Empire]]
[[Roman Empire]]
[[Han Dynasty]]

Bronze Age.md
---
[[Ancient Egyptians]]
[[Sumarians]]
[[Indus River Valley]]

Middle Ages.md
---
[[Dark Ages]]
[[Charlamegne Empire]]
[[Mongol Empire]]


Our program will ask for user input for the top level of the tree first

It will generate the empty markdown files with the names of the user input

next it will ask for the second level files per node in the first level

It will generate the empty markdown files for these and add text to the first level of nodes referencing these

User may exit program and nodes will still be instantiated

Enter Root Node -- History
    - Creates History.md (empty file for now)

Enter First Level Dependancies -- Classical Antiquity Bronze Age Middle Ages
    - appends input from this line to the History.md file with brackets around it

ENTER FIRST LEVEL DEPENDANCY LOOP

Enter Dependancies for Classical Antiquity -- Persian Empire Roman Empire Han Dynasty
    - appends input from this line to the Classical Antiquity file
    - appends Persian Empire Roman Empire Han Dynasty to list of second level dependancies

Repeat for rest of nodes

EXIT FIRST LEVEL DEPENDANCY LOOP

Ask user if they would like to continue for the second level dependancy?

If yes then for each node added to the list of the second level dependancies
prompt the user whether they would like to add nodes for this topic or not? Y/N
